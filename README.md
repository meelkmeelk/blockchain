# Jerotonin Blockchain

This is a my journey to building a blockchain from scratch. The initial commit serve as fundamentals of blockchain learning, with the aid of build
in modules such as hashlib(for the necessary hashing of text and inputs) as well as Flask(to run host the website that allows inputs).

Through many instances of getting liquidated in cyptocurrency trades, I became interested with the workings of the blockchain technology and how this
spectacular technology has helped and driven many different industries. Examples like how government stores our achievements(o level score) - explained
by Mr Gi himself and how major banks in Singapore are starting to work with crypto firms (DBS - TheSandBox) - from the news. 

According to ChatGPT, building a blockchain from scratch as a beginner is very challenging. Hence, I have decided to approach this challenge on a step by 
step basis.

I want this blockchain to be able to store some of my achievements (e-certificate) and maybe drawings that I created or even tokens if I am able to scale
up this blockchain. (all of these as non-fungible token)

This project will be coded in languages I learnt in my journey in ASRJC, well currently python, html.

This will my plan:
Phase 1: create a functional blockchain that hashes inputs as well as a webpage that allows inputs
Phase 2: create an input for jpg,jpeg files.
